		<p style = "font-family: courier";>
		James Clear has stated in his book Atomic Habits that:
		<blockquote style = "font-family: courier";>
		Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.
	    <pre style = "font-family: courier";>Twenty-six degrees.
			Twenty-seven.
			Twenty-eight.
			The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you
			Twenty-nine degrees.
			Thirty.
			Thirty-one.
		Still, nothing has happened.</pre>
		Then, thirty-two degrees. <strong>The ice begins to melt.</strong> A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.
			<br>...Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.
